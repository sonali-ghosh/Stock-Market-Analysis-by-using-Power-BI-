# Stock-Market-Analysis-by-using-Power-BI-
In this project, I used Power BI to analyze and visualize data related to the stock market. Here's a breakdown of what I did: Data Collection,Data Cleaning and Preparation,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Power BI Visualization,Interpretation and Recommendations.
Certainly! One challenge I encountered was handling missing data in the stock market dataset. To address this, I implemented a strategy to impute missing values by considering historical trends and using interpolation methods. This ensured that the analysis remained robust even when dealing with incomplete data.
The analysis played a crucial role in providing valuable insights to stakeholders. It helped in identifying optimal entry and exit points for investments, understanding market trends, and making informed decisions to maximize returns. The interactive Power BI dashboards also facilitated easy communication of complex data trends to non-technical stakeholders.
